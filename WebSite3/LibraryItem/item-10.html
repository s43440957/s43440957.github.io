The 'Carbine' was believed to have foundered off Green Island (Brisbane Courier 25/08/1891:2). The pilot cutter under Mr Dickson was dispatched to investigate Green Island and the adjacent reefs but nothing was discovered except the boat's anchor and chain (Brisbane Courier 11/08/1891:7). On the 7th of August 1891 the vessel was found near Cape Tribulation by the Port Douglas Customs boat crew. The 'Carbine' appeared to have been beached and abandoned. The inspection of the vessel revealed that the 'Carbine' had sustained very little damage if any (Brisbane Courier 25/08/1891:2).
