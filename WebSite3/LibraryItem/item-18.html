            The vessel was carrying a five ton cargo, horses and passengers. After passing the south-east end of Hinchinbrook Island the weather became hazardous, with south-east winds and a heavy sea. The course was altered. On the afternoon of the 21st, the vessel was driven ashore on Hinchinbrook Island and struck on the rocks at Cape Sandwich; within a couple of minutes the vessel broke up. Thirty-three of the passengers and crew safely made it to the shore; twenty were drowned. Twenty-seven of the survivors were recovered by the 'Spunkie'; the remaining survivors were recovered by the steamer 'Leichardt' and conveyed to Townsville.
