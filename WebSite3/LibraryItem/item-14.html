            According to the Argus (19/02/1867:4) the vessel was wrecked on the Great Barrier Reef, north of Cape Melville, this is supported by Loney (1993:62) and Stone (2006:109). However, according to Sydney Morning Herald (04/02/1867:4) the wreck of the 'Blue Bell' was recorded as being seen between 'B' Reef and Endeavour Reef; much further south than the Argus (19/02/1867:4) and the secondary sources would suggest.
